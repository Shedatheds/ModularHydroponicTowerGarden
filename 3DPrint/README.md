Printing recommendations

    0.3 mm layer
    3 wall count (0.4 mm nozzle = 1.2 mm)
    15% infill
    40 mm/s or more printing speed
    no support
    210x210 mm printing area required
    Use wide brims whenever the surface touching the bed is small (filling module, hollow planting modules)

With above settings a 3-way planting module takes 12 hours to print.

Watering schedule

Last year I started with 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off. Works well.
My current schedule is 5 minutes on and 20 minutes off.
You can further shorten the on-time and lengthen the off-time if power saving is a requirement. Let the roots of the plants be completely wet (should take a few minutes at least) and start the water pump again when they start to dry out (up to 1 hour).

If you don't have a timer then continuous water circulation is appropriate.
