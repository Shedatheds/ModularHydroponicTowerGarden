# ModularHydroponicTowerGarden
A modular 3D-printable hydroponic tower garden with Arduino compatible water pump controller.

**3DPrint** ~~folder contains the STL-files to print tower parts.~~ [STL-files are hosted on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3405964)

**Arduino** folder contains the source code and compiled binaries for the water pump controller written in Arduino IDE 1.8.12.

**GUI** folder contains the C# source code and compiled binary for an external computer written in Visual Studio 2019.

**PCB** folder contains everything to manufacture and assemble the hardware. You can buy it on ![Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/quantumframe/hydroponic-water-pump-controller-v10x/)
